## Runtime Systems

### Overview

This repo contains work for Sonia & Gwyneth's course project for CS263 Runtime Systems with Prof. Chandra Krintz at the University of California Santa Barbara. The aim of this project is to investigate embedded scripting languages that are used to develop authoring tools.

### Week 0

GOALS

- *Lua set-up.* Install Lua and run hello world
- *Runtimes and profilers.* Look into different runtimes and profilers.
- *Logistics.* Getting off the ground (vision statement, git repo).
- *Lua specifics.* How is Lua meant to be used? What is the Lua way?

OUTCOMES

-  *Lua set-up.* Went great!

	- A simple hello world in Lua
	[[helloworld.lua](../week0/helloworld.lua)]
	- [Our version of learnLuainXmin](../week0/learnluainXmin.lua)

  - A UCSB-themed command line memory game: [memory_puzzle.lua](../week0/memory_puzzle.lua)

-  *Runtimes and profilers.* We barely got started on this... maybe dipped our toes. Tabled to week 1.

	-
- *Lua specifics.* Wrote short scripts and learned some features of Lua... will continue to build on this.

	- We're still getting comfortable with writing code in Lua and don't feel like we've arrived at the fluency where we can do things the "Lua way".  

	- We wrote two simple command line games:

		- Tic Tac Toe [[tictactoe.lua]]
		- A UCSB-themed Matching Game []

	- We're writing out an overview that goes over lua specific features [[lua-specific-features.md](../week1/lua-specific-features.md)]


### Week 1

GOALS

- *Runtimes and profilers.* Look into different runtimes and profilers.
